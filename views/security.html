            <p><strong>Security as a QA issue</strong></p>
            <p>Security-related defects in any form should also be viewed as a QA issue. One can make an argument that
                software with
                quality defects and faults is more likely to have security vulnerabilities as well. Poor code quality
                leads to
                unpredictable behavior. From a user's perspective, that often manifests itself as poor usability. For an
                attacker, it
                provides an opportunity to stress the system in unexpected ways.</p>
            <p>A 2014 study by the Software Engineering Institute found that development groups with a strong focus on
                quality tended
                to have fewer vulnerabilities in their source code. Quality and software security are not separate
                worlds, but rather
                two sides of the same coin—the bug that manifests as a system failure today could be a vulnerability
                exploited by an
                attacker tomorrow. Software security is just another important part of building good software.</p>
            <p>Software security and QA are both concerned with removing risks. Software security teams work to remove
                security risks,
                and quality assurance teams work to remove risks to quality.</p>
            <p><strong>Reasons for security testing to find a place in the QA program</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>It fits the QA role.</strong> Following security practices and processes, the whole team in
                    SDLC ideally should be able to meet the requirements by
                    checking and testing the application vulnerabilities from a security point as well. It is the duty
                    of the QA to look out
                    for any vulnerabilities whether it is in the network, system software, client-side application or
                    server-side
                    application security. The QA teams have to train and adopt the security testing methods and
                    processes, even if they do
                    not have any application security background.</li>
                <li><strong>A high-quality application is a secure application. </strong>The standards for quality
                    include security as well. The QA framework, which has QA testing as an integral part is
                    expected to test and confirm whether the application is secure as part of releasing a satisfactory
                    application. Many use
                    cases of security testing encompass basic areas like password encryption, permissions, logins,
                    session timeouts and
                    cookies to more advanced ways of bypassing existing controls.</li>
                <li><strong>Security QA is cost-effective.</strong>It is not always feasible to have a separate security
                    team of experts for security testing. With advanced automated
                    testing that can monitor and detect vulnerabilities, security testing is becoming manageable for QA
                    teams. Many of the
                    automated tools comply with GDPR and PCI DSS requirements, hence addressing the complex compliance
                    needs of an
                    application. Isolated security teams often perform a scan but can’t provide additional understanding
                    beyond what the
                    tool tells them because they don’t have the breadth and depth of knowledge into just how the
                    application works.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Security Features</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Add encryption to Password. Hashing and salting is considered to be safest security concept. SHA and
                    MD among the most popular one out there!
                </li>
                <li>Security headers should be added! <br>
                    <strong>Content-Security-Policy</strong> is an effective measure to protect your site from XSS
                    attacks. By whitelisting sources of approved content, you can
                    prevent the browser from loading malicious assets. <br>
                    <strong>X-Frame-Options</strong> tells the browser whether you want to allow your site to be framed
                    or not. By preventing a browser from framing your
                    site you can defend against attacks like clickjacking. Recommended value "X-Frame-Options:
                    SAMEORIGIN". <br>
                    <strong>X-Content-Type-Options</strong> stops a browser from trying to MIME-sniff the content type
                    and forces it to stick with the declared content-type. The
                    only valid value for this header is "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff". <br>
                    <strong>Referrer-Policy</strong> is a new header that allows a site to control how much information
                    the browser includes with navigations away from a
                    document and should be set by all sites.
